Designing a REST API - supporting JSON.

Routes :- 

1. GET/api/users - List all users    (metioning 'api' is good practice, if this is throwing a json data to browser, mobile or other devices)
   GET/users - HTML Document Render

2. GET/api/user/1 - get the user with ID 1.
   similarly for (GET/user/2) - should get the user with ID 2.
   
   here user-1, user-2 -> is dynamic path parameters.
   ex : GET/api/users/:id
   here, :id - dynamic variable

3. POST/api/users - create new user.
    
4. PATCH/api/user/1 - edit the user with ID.

5. DELETE/api/users/1 - Delete the user with ID.

So, to perform above task, we need data. So for data we need to use mongoDB for retriving the data from it.
or API, but we don't have any of these, so we will hardcode it for now to test all.
 
NOTE : "mockaroo.com" - generate fake data for testing purposes.
