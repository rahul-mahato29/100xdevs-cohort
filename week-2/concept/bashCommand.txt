--Basic Bash Commands--

Q- What is Bash ?

It is command line interpreater language, that help's in interacting with our operating system.

1. pwd -> print working directory
2. cd -> change directory
3. cd .. -> go back by one folder
4. ls - listing all the files of the current folder
5. mkdir - make directory / create directory
6. touch - create files inside a particular folder
7. rm (file_name) - to delete a file
8. rm -r (folder_name) - to delete a folder
_________________________________________________
Deleting with Confirmation:
If you want to be prompted for confirmation before deleting each file or folder, 
you can use the -i option with the rm command. For example:

rm -i example.txt       # For a file
rm -ri example_folder   # For a folder and its contents

After running these commands, you'll be prompted to confirm the deletion of each file or folder.

9. cat - print the content of a file
10. vi - VIM command (allow us to edit files)
11. mv - helps in moving a file or folder from one place to other.

syntax : mv (source) (destination)
Ex : $ mv a.txt newfolder
or,  $ mv file.txt documents/
or,  $ mv file.txt /path/to/destination/

12. mv old_fileName new_fileName -> Rename a file 
13. cp -> helps in copy a file or folder

syntax : cp (file/folder_name)  (folderName_toPaste)
Ex : $ cp a.txt newfolder

#case : circuits/test is a directory (not copied)
$ cp -r circuits/test contracts (now test will copied to contracts) - here we are coping recursively

14. npm (node package manager) ->  it helps in managing the external libraries that we use in our local machine.

syntax : npm install libraryName

for example : express, so to use express(which is an external library) in our local machine, we use "npm" command, which will help us in using the 
              express libraries, and this express library is register on NPM(NPM is a place where , people register there librabies which is written by them) 
              and we can use those librabies by using "npm" command to resolve/do our task.

15. node -> it give us a playground to run or test javascript code.
16. node a.js -> it helps to compile and run our javascript file locally.

Q - More about files and what are the different things that we can do with files.

-what is long format of files and directories ?

The "ls -l" command, is used to list files and directories in long fromat. The  long format provides
detailed information about each file and directory. 

Example :
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1234 Dec 20 10:30 myfile.txt
drwxr-xr-x 2 user group 4096 Dec 20 10:30 mydirectory

1.File Type and Permissions:

1.1 - The first character indicates the file type:

- : Regular file
d : Directory
l : Symbolic link
c : Character special file (e.g., devices)
b : Block special file (e.g., devices)
p : Named pipe (FIFO)
s : Socket

1.2 - The next nine characters represent the file permissions:

-> The three characters at the beginning indicate the owner's permissions.
-> The next three characters indicate the group's permissions.
-> The last three characters indicate others' (or world's) permissions.

1.3 - For each set of three characters (e.g., rwx), the meanings are:

r: Read permission
w: Write permission
x: Execute permission

2. Number of Hard Links:

The second column represents the number of hard links to the file or directory. 
Hard links are additional names (entries) pointing to the same inode on disk.

3. Owner:

The third column shows the username of the file or directory owner.

4. Group:

The fourth column shows the group associated with the file or directory.

5. File Size:

The fifth column represents the size of the file in bytes.

6. Modification Time:

The next three columns represent the date and time when the file or directory was last modified.

7. Name:

The last column shows the name of the file or directory.

Example :
Desktop/Assignment/100xdevs-cohort/week-1/assignment$ ls -l

-rwxrwxrwx 1 mahatorahul mahatorahul  758 Dec  4 09:13 README.md
drwxrwxrwx 1 mahatorahul mahatorahul 4096 Dec  4 09:13 easy
drwxrwxrwx 1 mahatorahul mahatorahul 4096 Dec  4 09:13 hard
drwxrwxrwx 1 mahatorahul mahatorahul 4096 Dec  4 09:13 medium

And,
Desktop/Assignment/100xdevs-cohort/week-1/assignment/easy$ ls -l

-rwxrwxrwx 1 mahatorahul mahatorahul 305 Dec  4 09:13 anagram.js
-rwxrwxrwx 1 mahatorahul mahatorahul 525 Dec  4 09:13 expenditure-analysis.js
-rwxrwxrwx 1 mahatorahul mahatorahul 250 Dec  4 09:13 findLargestElement.js


--Some List Commands--

1. ls - list all the files of current directory
_________________________________________________
1.1 ls newDir     -> to check all the files/folders inside newDir directory
1.2 ls -l         -> to check the details about all the files(it's size, owner/author, last modified date, file type(either a file or folder))
1.3 ls -R newDir  -> to check all the subDirectories of all the directories that newDir directory containing
1.4 ls -t         -> display a list of files and directories in the current directory, sorted by modification time, with the newest ones at the top
1.5 ls -lt        -> shows detailed information about each file, including modification time, and the files are sorted with the newest(last modified) at the top
1.6 ls -lr        -> shows detailed information about each file, including modification time, and the files are sorted reversly with the oldest(modified) at the top
1.7 ls -la        -> to check all the files(including all the hidden files also) & the files name which are proceded by dot(.) are the hidden file
1.8 ls -s         -> list the files in the current directory along with their allocated sizes in blocks
1.9 ls -lR | grep .json -> list files recursively in a directory and its subdirectories (ls -lR) and then filter the output to show only the lines containing the string ".json"
1.10 ls *.js      -> list all files in the current directory that have a ".js" extension.
1.11 ls zoom*     -> list files and directories in the current directory that start with the characters "zoom".
1.12 ls ..        -> list the contents(files and folder) of the parent directory (one level up) from the current directory

NOTE : we can use multiple combination of commands and can check the files according to our requirement.
Example : ls -lRa newdir/snake_game

2. cat - print/view the content of a file

2.1 cat > newfile.txt  -> can add content in file named newfile.
2.2 cat >> newfile.txt -> can append content in the file named newfile with the content which is already present in the file.

3. mkdir test && cd test   -> it will create a directory test and also navigate to test from it's previous directory.
4. mkdir -p newDesk/script -> creating a directory(script) inside newDesk recursively(means without navigating inside the newDesk directory we can create the a new directory inside it)
