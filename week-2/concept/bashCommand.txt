Deleting with Confirmation:
If you want to be prompted for confirmation before deleting each file or folder, 
you can use the -i option with the rm command. For example:

rm -i example.txt       # For a file
rm -ri example_folder   # For a folder and its contents

After running these commands, you'll be prompted to confirm the deletion of each file or folder.
